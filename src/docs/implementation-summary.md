## Implementation Steps

1. Update Login component to include email field and validation
2. Implement authentication service for email/password validation
3. Create AdminAccounts component for managing admin users
4. Create AddAdmin component for adding new admin accounts
5. Update Sidebar to include navigation to admin management pages
6. Implement localStorage-based storage for admin accounts
7. Add route protection for admin-only pages
8. Test authentication flow with multiple admin accounts
9. Test admin account management functionality

## Security Considerations
- Client-side authentication is not sufficient for production use
- Passwords should be hashed in a real implementation
- localStorage is not secure for sensitive data
- Route protection is implemented for user experience, not real security

## Testing Plan
- Test authentication flow with valid and invalid credentials
- Test admin account management functionality (add, delete, view)
- Verify localStorage persistence
- Test edge cases and error conditions
